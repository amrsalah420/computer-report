		<p>Operating system is a software that manages all the hardware and software processes that happens in a computer and provides common services for <br>
		computer programs. The operating system manages software hardware processes such as: <br>
		1) Input devices like keyboard and mouse.
		2) Output devices like monitors and printers.
		3) Storage devices such as internal and external drives.	
		<br><br>The OS also provides services to facilitate the efficient execution and management of memory allocations. If several programs are running at <br>
		at the same time, the OS will allocate the computer's resources to make sure that each one of them receives what it needs to function.<br>
		Some operating systems were developed in the 1950s, when computers could only execute one program at a time. Later in the decade, computers included many <br>
		software programs which were linked together to create the beginning of today's operating systems.
		<br><br><h3>Operating system components:</h3>
		<br><b>kernel:</b> This provides basic-level control over all of the computer hardware devices. Its main roles include reading data from memory and writing <br>
		datat to memory, processing execution orders, determining how data is received and sent by devices, such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse and determining <br>
		how to interpret data recieved from networks.<br>
		<br><b>User interface:</b> This component allows interaction with the user, which may occur through graphical icons and a desktop or through a command line.<br>
		The UI is further devided into command line interface, consisting of a text-based interface where advanced users can prompt specific commands by typing them,<br>
		and then devides into Graphical user Interface.<br>
		<br><b>Application Programming interfaces:</b> This component allows application developers to write module code.
