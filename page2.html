		<p><b>Single/multi - tasking:</b> A single tasking system can only run one program at a time, while multi-tasking allows more than one program <br>
		to be running at the same time. this is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes.
		<br><br><b>Single/multi user:</b> single user systems have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem. <br>
		A multi user system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identifiy processes and resources, such as disk space and permitting <br>
		multiple users to interact with the system at the same time.
		<br><br><b>Embedded system:</b> Embedded systems are designed to be used in embedded computer system. They are designed to operate on small machines <br>
		with less autonomy.
		<br><br><b>Real-time system:</b> A real-time operating system is an operating system that guarantess to process events or data by a specific moment <br>
		in time. A real-time operating system may be single or multi-tasking, but while multi-tasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms so that a <br>
		deterministic nature of behavior is achieved.
