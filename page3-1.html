		<p>Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, and <br>
		their complex and more modern form didn't exit until the early 1960s. Hardware features were added that enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts and parallel<br>
		processing. In 1980s, personal computers became popular and operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers.
		<br><br>In the 1940s, the earliest elecronic digital systems had no operating system. Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical <br>
		switches or by jumper wires on plugboards. These were special-purpose systems that generated ballistics tables for military or control the printing of payroll<br>
		checks from data on punched cards.
